"""The headless bot handoff matches the CLI and the commits that landed it.

How this fails: the note is missing, a command is not the one `./pfy` help
advertises, a cited SHA is not the commit with that subject, an em dash
slips in, or Still open is empty. A bot then runs the wrong command or
treats a closed gap as open.
The SHA check skips when the landed commit is not in this checkout
(`git cat-file -e <sha>^{commit}` fails), including a shallow clone and
a one-commit recheck. It still runs when that commit is present.
Recover: put the four commands back, cite the git SHAs, and list what is
still open in ASCII hyphens. Point the prior handoff, the pfy module map,
and the README simple path at this note.
