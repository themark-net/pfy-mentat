# Subtree & Submodule Policy for Individual Tool Repos

This document defines the selective policy for embedding or tracking external repositories as always-available copies inside this catalog. The goal is reproducibility and pipeline independence without repo bloat.

**Core Principle**: Embed or pin only what delivers clear integration value to the Grok CLI + agents + MCP code memory + DSPy/LiteLLM + continuous pipeline stack. Most tools stay as documented + pinned-SHA references.

## When to Use Subtree (Rare)

Use `git subtree` only when **all** of the following are true:
- The repo is small (< ~50 MB full history).
- It is S-tier or high A-tier per the staged rubric in CATEGORIZATION.md.
- You actively customize, vendor, or deeply integrate its code (not just consume via API).
- Having the exact source versioned inside this repo improves pipeline reproducibility or offline work more than a shallow clone + pinned commit.

**Examples of likely candidates**: Tiny custom MCP memory backends, small DSPy module extensions, or a minimal agent harness you fork and modify heavily.

**Explicit exclusions**:
- Large inference engines (Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, MLX full history).
- Full IDE agents or UIs (Continue.dev, Aider, Open WebUI).
- Any repo whose primary output is models, weights, or large binaries.

Subtree duplicates the entire child history under the prefix. This is powerful for the rare qualifying case but scales poorly.

## When to Use Submodules (Preferred for Most Embedded Cases)

Use git submodules when you want a lightweight pointer to a pinned commit but do not need to edit the child code inside this repo. Size impact is minimal.

- Good for small-to-medium tools you want versioned but not heavily customized here.
- Also suitable for high-value *aggregate/list* repos (see sources/aggregates.md).

Add with:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/user/repo.git tools/<short-name>
git commit -m "submodule: add <name> at <commit>"
```

Update later:
```bash
git submodule update --remote tools/<short-name>
# or pin specific commit
git -C tools/<short-name> checkout <sha>
git add tools/<short-name>
git commit -m "submodule: pin <name> to <sha>"
```

Track in `.gitmodules` (auto-managed) and document in this file or data/tools.json.

## Default Approach for Most Tools (Recommended)

For the large majority of individual tools:
1. Score with the full staged rubric (CATEGORIZATION.md).
2. Record in TOOLS.md table + data/tools.json with these fields:
   - `github`
   - `pinned_commit` (exact SHA or tag for reproducibility)
   - `notes` (integration notes for Grok CLI, MCP, pipeline use)
3. In pipelines / examples / CI: perform shallow clone at the pinned commit.
   Example:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/user/repo.git tools/<name>
   cd tools/<name> && git fetch origin <sha> && git checkout <sha>
   ```
4. No embedding. This keeps the tracking repo lean while guaranteeing exact versions on demand.

## Workflow for Adding a Subtree (When Criteria Met)

```bash
# 1. Add at specific commit (recommended over branch for pinning)
git subtree add --prefix=tools/<short-name> https://github.com/user/repo.git <commit-sha-or-tag> --squash \
  -m "subtree: add <name> at <commit>"

# 2. Record immediately
# - Add entry to SUBTREES.md (below)
# - Update data/tools.json with "subtree_path": "tools/<short-name>", "pinned_commit": "<sha>"
# - Add row or update in TOOLS.md with integration notes

# 3. Future selective update (only when upstream has valuable changes you want)
git subtree pull --prefix=tools/<short-name> https://github.com/user/repo.git <branch> --squash
```

**Never** run broad `git subtree pull` on a schedule. Only pull when you have reviewed changes and decided they improve your pipeline.

## Tracking Requirements

Every subtreed or submoduled repo must have an entry in this file (or linked section) containing:
- Short name and prefix/path
- Full upstream URL
- Pinned commit SHA or tag at addition time
- Rationale (why subtree/submodule vs default pinned-SHA approach)
- Last update date and reason
- Link to corresponding TOOLS.md row and data/tools.json entry
- Any custom patches or vendored modifications made inside the prefix

## Current Subtrees / Submodules

*(None yet — this section will be populated on first use. The first X seed post tools will be evaluated against the criteria above.)*

## Integration with Existing Rubric & Pipeline Vision

Subtree/submodule decisions are **downstream** of the Stage 0–4 scoring in CATEGORIZATION.md. Only high-value, integration-heavy tools that pass the gate and deliver measurable pipeline leverage (Grok CLI compatibility, MCP memory hooks, DSPy optimizability, CI reproducibility) qualify for embedding. The default pinned-SHA + shallow-clone path satisfies "always available" for the rest without compromising repo health.

This policy will be reviewed after the first 2–3 real embeddings or when repo size growth becomes measurable.
