# pfy-deanery (Deanery)

**pfy-deanery (Deanery) — Your PFY. It gets sent out, finds the tools, applies the standards, and reports back with receipts.**

pfy-deanery is both a high-standard catalog of local LLM development tools *and* an orientation toward building the software that actually deploys and runs them reliably.

The system (the PFY) is sent out to discover candidates, apply strict local-first standards, reject what doesn’t meet them, and deliver only the components that are worth using. The goal is not merely “tools that exist,” but tooling that helps people ship working local LLM systems instead of fighting endless “it works on my machine” problems — both for the tools themselves and for the products built with them.

Repository: https://github.com/themark-net/pfy-deanery

Formerly **pfy-mentat** (renamed 2026-11-11; GitHub redirects the old URL). For one transition period some names keep the old spelling on purpose: the default state dir `~/.pfy-mentat` (`PFY_STATE_DIR` overrides), checkout paths such as `~/DEVELOP/pfy-mentat` used by the catalog loop units, the self-hosted runner label `pfy-mentat`, the agent-cage image tag and `/workspace/pfy-mentat`, and the `mentat` launcher alias that `./pfy install` still writes next to `deanery`.

## Simple path

Operator environment: local inference, then product stage (honest skip if a piece is missing), then the native operator window. Loop paints **LOCAL COMPUTE | CLOUD ORCHESTRATION** plus gathered catalog **MODULES**. **Launch session** applies enabled modules into an enterable TUI — that session is the proof. Attach grok/opencode remains on the Attach tab. Do not exec a harness into the GUI process.

```bash
./pfy           # env-stage → native window (no harness exec; no engine daemon unless opted in)
./pfy board     # same native window (Tauri if built, else already-on-box webkit, else stdlib tk)
./pfy start grok  # named harness after inference/stage (still execs that harness)
./pfy launch      # one command: fill missing lane local, toolsets bare, ready harness, then the TUI
./pfy models    # inspect-only: live GET /v1/models (and Ollama /api/tags); usage if exposed
./pfy install   # PATH launchers deanery and pfy (default ~/.local/bin)
deanery         # same as ./pfy, from any directory
```

`./pfy install` writes POSIX launchers `deanery` and `pfy`, so `deanery` from any directory behaves like `./pfy`. It also writes `mentat`, a transition alias from before the project was renamed from pfy-mentat (2026-11-11); it will be dropped in a later release. The default directory is `$HOME/.local/bin`. Pass `--prefix` for another directory (for example `/opt/pfy-deanery/bin`). If that directory is not writable, the command prints `sudo ./pfy install --prefix ...` and does not run sudo. If the directory is not on PATH, it prints the exact line to add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`. For the default directory that line is `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`. It does not edit those files. Remove the launchers with `./pfy install --uninstall` or `./pfy uninstall --launchers`.

Headless (no GUI): `./pfy launch --headless`, then `./pfy launch status` and `./pfy launch stop`.

Daily build: [docs/QUICKSTART-pfy-build.md](docs/QUICKSTART-pfy-build.md).

Bare `./pfy`, `./pfy up`, `./pfy start` with no name, and `./pfy board` do not start FreeToken, llama-swap, llama-server, or `ollama serve`. When the engine is down they print one line with the start command and open the window with the engine down. Opt in with `PFY_START_ENGINE=1`, `--start-engine`, or yes at the terminal prompt. `./pfy start <harness>` still starts the engine before that harness. `./pfy env` still starts it. `./pfy board` is the same window. Optional `./pfy board --open` is a browser hatch only (not the main path). Board is not a supervisor.

If continue or agent-cage is the active harness: FAIL and copy `pfy harness use grok` (no grok/opencode fallback). Chips bind `./pfy status` **live** (`missing` not `unknown`).

`./pfy start <harness>` runs inference and stage, then that harness. Listing model tags is not success. Empty `ollama ps` is OK. A missing harness process is not. FreeToken model env: **`PFY_FT_MODEL`** (then `LOCAL_CODER_MODEL` or `FREETOKEN_MODEL`).

Tauri is primary when `gui/operator/src-tauri/target/{release,debug}/pfy-operator` exists. Else already-on-box webkit (`scripts/pfy-gui.py`). Else stdlib tk with the same IA (Loop local/cloud + modules → Launch session, engine status, env-stage, Attach tab for grok / opencode sidecar). pywebview is PFY_GUI_DEV=1 only. The window always opens; not install-tips-as-UI.

## Daily build

Headless cloud build. Review stays on. Nothing is pushed.

```bash
./pfy build "<task>"
```

`./pfy build` with no task exits 2 and prints that command. `./pfy build --help` is the flag list. A dry-run (`./pfy build "<task>" --dry-run`) checks the defaults without calling grok:

- Repo: the git toplevel of the current directory. Pass `--repo DIR` to build a different repo. This is not "whatever directory contains the `pfy` script" unless that directory is the current one.
- Base: `origin/main` when that ref exists, otherwise `HEAD`. Pass `--base REF` to pick another ref. A clone of one non-main branch often has no `origin/main`, so the base is `HEAD`.
- Gate: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .`. In this repository that is the full suite. For a small task, pass `--repo` and `--test-cmd`. Worked example: `bash tests/fixtures/mvp_receipt/init_fixture.sh "$PWD/tmp/mvp-fixture-repo"` seeds a red fixture, and `tests/fixtures/mvp_receipt/check_receipt.py` checks the receipt.
- One grok call waits up to 1200 seconds (`--timeout`). `--retries` defaults to 2, so 3 attempts. `--no-review` skips the review call.
- `grok` must already be on `PATH` and logged in (`grok login`). This command does not read `auth.json` and does not load `.env`. It does not start a local model. `--local` is opt-in. `-p` is the jev dogfood wrap, not the daily command.
- A PASS leaves branch `cloud/<slug>-<stamp>` and `pipelines/dogfood/build-cloud/<stamp>/receipt.json` in the target repo. The caller branch stays as it was. Nothing is pushed.

Operator card: [docs/ops/pfy-build-daily.md](docs/ops/pfy-build-daily.md). Module map: [docs/modules/pfy-build.md](docs/modules/pfy-build.md). Where those two disagree with `./pfy build --help` on the default repo, trust the help text.

## What it is

- A living, gate-checked catalog of local LLM dev tools, frameworks, patterns, and methods.
- An operator posture (the PFY) for discovery on X and elsewhere: apply non-negotiable criteria, log every decision with receipts, and keep the catalog current.
- A deliberate focus on **reproducibility and deployment**, not just “it builds” — components and patterns that support shipping working systems.
- Practical operator stack: **Grok CLI**, custom agents, **MCP** code memory, LiteLLM routing, **containerized harnesses** (agent-cage), and process docs so multi-session agents stay aligned.

## Core principles

- **Local first, always.** Tools must be self-hostable and runnable on normal developer hardware with minimal ceremony.
- **Permissive and embeddable.** Licenses must allow real use and modification.
- **Receipts over vibes.** Every inclusion or rejection is logged with explicit reasoning in [`sources/x-posts.md`](sources/x-posts.md) (and related sources).
- **Beyond “it builds.”** While many projects struggle to even compile successfully, pfy-deanery orients toward components and practices that support working, deployable results — for the tools themselves and for the systems people build with them.

We recognize that perfect reproducibility is impossible in computing (just as Ansible’s idempotency guarantees can be broken by the environment). The intent is still to raise the baseline: tools and patterns that are more likely to result in something that actually runs and keeps running, rather than another local-only prototype.

## Stage 0 gate

Items must satisfy all of the following before catalog consideration (full rubric: [CATEGORIZATION.md](CATEGORIZATION.md)):

- Runnable self-hosted path under ~5 minutes on a clean Ubuntu or macOS system (or a documented one-liner).
- Permissive open-source license suitable for embedding and modification.
- Working hello-world or quickstart that demonstrates the core capability.

Rejections are logged with short, explicit reasons. There is no silent ignoring of candidates.

## Goals

- Maintain a living, versioned catalog of the best local-first LLM tools.
- Apply consistent, multi-stage evaluation criteria for compatibility, performance, agentic capability, and pipeline readiness.
- Identify synergies for a unified local development stack (inference + agents + memory + orchestration + CI/CD).
- Enable rapid prototyping and deployment of custom pipelines using the highest-ranked components.
- Support Grok CLI as primary interface initially, with fallback/hybrid to other identified toolsets based on task requirements.
- Provide selective, reproducible copies of critical tools via pinned commits (rare subtree) while keeping the tracking repo lean.
- Test integrations in **versioned container sandboxes** (agent-cage) so host systems stay clean and results are reproducible.

## Using the catalog

| Consume | Path |
|---------|------|
| Human catalog | [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md) — categories, scores, tiers, notes |
| Machine catalog | [data/tools.json](data/tools.json) — structured, must stay valid JSON |
| Decision receipts | [sources/x-posts.md](sources/x-posts.md) — examined posts and decisions |
| Taxonomy & rubric | [CATEGORIZATION.md](CATEGORIZATION.md) — Stage 0 + weighted stages → 0–100 → S/A/B/C |
| Work queue | [docs/TODO.md](docs/TODO.md) — deeper eval and integration work |

### Lifecycle (track, catalog, eval, integrate, promote)

`./pfy catalog` lists the Active Catalog table, then any stage card that is not already one of those rows. Intake does not write TOOLS.md. Browse does not add a tool and does not change `integration_stage`. `./pfy eval` is the product structural gate (`make eval-integration-change`). It writes `pipelines/eval`. It does not call Grok and does not push `main`. It is not a catalog verdict. Catalog verdicts are `scripts/eval_lane.sh`.

| Step | Command |
|------|---------|
| Find or dedupe | `python3 scripts/catalog_intake_dedupe.py "<source>"` |
| Write an I0 card | same command with `--write-card` |
| Eval toward I2 | `scripts/eval_lane.sh --slug <slug>` (calls Grok, then fast-forwards `main`). `--dry-run --state DIR` exits before Grok and the push |
| Integrate I2 to I3 | `scripts/integrate_lane.sh --slug <slug>` (same). `--dry-run` exits before Grok and the push |
| Apply a verdict | `python3 scripts/catalog_apply_verdict.py` |
| Raise a ceiling | `python3 scripts/catalog_auto_raise.py` |

Skills: `catalog-intake-dedupe`, `catalog-eval-lane`, `catalog-integrate-lane`, `catalog-apply-and-ceiling`, `catalog-loop-operator`. Do not run the lane scripts against `origin` from a test. Pass `--root` and `--state`.

**Default tracking:** pinned commit + shallow clone (`data/tools.json`). Rare subtree only if [SUBTREES.md](SUBTREES.md) criteria are met.

**Catalog triple-write rule:** every processed tool seed must update `sources/x-posts.md` (if social/paper) **and** `TOOLS.md` **and** `data/tools.json` (JSON must parse). `/catalog-docs seed` or `/catalog-docs audit` enforces this.

### Automation (the PFY)

Discovery is not a slowly rotting list: candidates from X (and related monitors such as [@tom_doerr](docs/automation/tom-doer-monitor.md)) are triaged against the gate and relevance rules, with traceable entries for what was examined. Catalog updates happen only when justified. Full daily unattended PFY automation is evolving; until then, operators and agents run the same receipt-backed process by hand or on demand.

### Philosophy on deployment and working results

pfy-deanery does not treat “it builds on my machine” as success. While we cannot eliminate all environment-specific failures, selection criteria and patterns here prioritize components that support reproducible builds *and* working deployments. People using this catalog should spend less time debugging why something only works for the original author and more time shipping functional local LLM systems.

## Process docs (agents & humans)

| Artifact | Path | Role |
|----------|------|------|
| **Design** | [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) | Master goals, system shape, non-goals |
| **Architecture** | [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | Short structural snapshot |
| **ADR** | [docs/adr/](docs/adr/README.md) | Settled decisions + **rejected alternatives** |
| **TODO** | [docs/TODO.md](docs/TODO.md) | Ordered next steps (links to OQs) |
| **Open questions** | [docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md](docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md) | TBDs; detail may live next to work citing `OQ-NNNN` |
| **Agent entry** | [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) | Mandatory read list + do-nots |
| **Contributing** | [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) | How to add seeds/tools |
| **Catalog docs skill** | `/catalog-docs` | Keep README, triple-write catalog, harness docs consistent |
| **Consultant eval** | [docs/ops/consultant-eval.md](docs/ops/consultant-eval.md) | Outsider map: real vs stub vs catalog; `./pfy` + `make eval-structural` |
| **Module docs** | [docs/modules/](docs/modules/README.md) | Operator + agent maps for pfy, detector, grok, opencode, cage, write-guard |
| **Phoenix trace sink** | [docs/ops/phoenix.md](docs/ops/phoenix.md) | Loopback Arize Phoenix (OTLP + UI). The operator enables the user unit. |

When architecture pivots: `/adr`. When something is unsettled: `/open-questions`. When documenting this repo: **`/catalog-docs`**. Work queue: `docs/TODO.md`.

## Skills (Grok)

After `./bootstrap/grok-cli/install.sh`, these are available:

| Skill | Slash | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **catalog-docs** | `/catalog-docs` | **This repo’s** documentation skill (README, TOOLS/json/x-posts triple-write, harness, audit) |
| **one-shot** | `/one-shot` | Min questions; cheap local→cage→cloud loops until DoD green (lab required) |
| **marketing-council** | `/marketing-council` | First-party multi-advisor marketing council + dissenter (T-0011) |
| **investigate** | `/investigate` | Root-cause debugging — no fix without confirmed hypothesis (T-0017) |
| docs | `/docs` | Portable module/ops docs for any project |
| adr | `/adr` | Architecture decisions + rejected alternatives |
| open-questions | `/open-questions` | TBD parking lot |
| project-process | `/project-process` | Scaffold DESIGN/ADR/TODO/OQ into a new repo |
| karpathy-guidelines | (auto) | Anti-overcomplication defaults |
| ponytail | (via skills path) | Minimalism / YAGNI modes |
| mattpocock subset | (via skills path) | tdd, code-review, to-spec (T-0011) |

Project skill source of truth: [`.grok/skills/`](.grok/skills/) (also vendored under `bootstrap/grok-cli/skills/` for reinstall).  
One-shot design: [docs/ops/one-shot-workflow.md](docs/ops/one-shot-workflow.md) · ADR-0008.

## Current status (v0.4 → G8 launch)

- **`./pfy`** simple surface (ADR-0012): bare `./pfy` / `up` / unnamed `start` / `board` open the window and do not start an engine unless opted in (`PFY_START_ENGINE=1`, `--start-engine`, or a terminal yes); named `start <harness>` and `./pfy env` still start inference; `models` is inspect-only
- Product structural gate stays `./pfy eval` (`make eval-integration-change`, writes `pipelines/eval`). Catalog verdicts are `scripts/eval_lane.sh`, not that command.


- Methodology: taxonomy, rubric, SUBTREES, aggregates intake.
- Process layout: DESIGN + multi-file ADR + TODO + open questions (ADR-0001).
- **Grok CLI bootstrap** + **project-process** scaffold (replayable operator + new-project process).
- **Phase 0 catalog sync:** mobile X seeds Entries 001–010 + structured `data/tools.json` (18 tools); see [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md).
- **agent-cage (PNNL)** as primary **container integration lab** under [`harness/agent-cage/`](harness/agent-cage/) (Make + pin + MCP).
- **`/catalog-docs`** skill for repository documentation consistency.
- Deploy runbook: [docs/ops/DEPLOY.md](docs/ops/DEPLOY.md).

**Next steps** (authoritative: [docs/TODO.md](docs/TODO.md) · GitHub issues):

1. ~~Cage smokes + tool integrations~~ (done) — see `make help-platform`  
2. Write-guard MCP implement — T-0031  
3. Skill ports (mattpocock / marketing-council / gstack patterns) — T-0011  
4. Eval harness prototype — T-0003 / OQ-0002  

Plans: [docs/ops/harness-integration-framework.md](docs/ops/harness-integration-framework.md).

## Deploy runbook

Full new-machine path: **[docs/ops/DEPLOY.md](docs/ops/DEPLOY.md)**.

## Bootstrap (new machine + new projects)

### Simple path (recommended — G8)

One launcher. Inference first, then product stage, then the native operator window:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/themark-net/pfy-deanery.git
cd pfy-deanery
./pfy setup              # env + Grok skills if CLI present
./pfy install            # deanery and pfy on PATH (default ~/.local/bin)
deanery                  # same as ./pfy, from any directory
./pfy                    # env-stage → native window (engine starts only if opted in)
./pfy board              # same native window
./pfy models             # inspect-only; listing tags is not success
# or: ./pfy up            # same as bare ./pfy
# or: ./pfy start grok    # named harness after inference/stage
```

Bare `./pfy` opens the native window (Tauri if built, else already-on-box webkit, else stdlib tk). pywebview is PFY_GUI_DEV=1 only. Browser `--open` is not the main path.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `./pfy` / `./pfy up` / unnamed `./pfy start` | Env-stage, then native operator window. Does not start an engine daemon unless `PFY_START_ENGINE=1`, `--start-engine`, or a terminal yes. Does not exec a harness into that process. |
| `./pfy start <harness>` | Same bring-up, then that harness (stubs: STUB + issue, exit 2) |
| `./pfy board` / `./pfy board --open` | Same native window. --open is an optional browser hatch (honest skip if it fails) |
| `./pfy models` | Inspect-only: list models from the live endpoint (`GET /v1/models`, Ollama `/api/tags`) |
| `./pfy models pull <name>` | Live engine: FreeToken records name for next `ft serve --model`; Ollama `pull`; llama-* honest skip |
| `./pfy harness list` | Grok, OpenCode, Hermes, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Exo, … |
| `./pfy harness use opencode` | Switch active harness (stubs print next steps) |
| `./pfy stage` | Product stage (`make env-stage`) |
| `./pfy eval` | Product structural gate (`make eval-integration-change`). Writes `pipelines/eval`. Not `scripts/eval_lane.sh`. |
| `./pfy ship` | Product verify (`make product-ship`) |

Design: **G8** · [ADR-0012](docs/adr/0012-simple-harness-agnostic-launch.md) · [simple-launch.md](docs/ops/simple-launch.md).  
Platform builders: `make help-platform`. Product surface is `make help` (onboard / stage / ship).

### 1. Clone + environment profiles (advanced / same as before)


```bash
git clone git@github.com:themark-net/pfy-deanery.git
cd pfy-deanery
make env-init                 # creates .env from example (gitignored)
# edit .env: DEPLOY_PROFILE=local-only|balanced|max-performance + secrets
make env-check                # validates required vars for profile
```

Daily headless build is the [Daily build](#daily-build) section above. `make env-init` does not log grok in. `grok login` does. `./pfy build` does not load `.env`.

| Profile | Intent |
|---------|--------|
| `local-only` | Local models only; no cloud keys required |
| `balanced` | Default — local bulk + cloud (e.g. Grok) for hard tasks |
| `max-performance` | Cloud-first; local optional |

Registry of all vars: [bootstrap/env/REGISTRY.md](bootstrap/env/REGISTRY.md).  
Design: [docs/ops/deployment-profiles.md](docs/ops/deployment-profiles.md) · ADR-0006.

### 2. Operator environment (Grok skills + MCP)

```bash
# After installing Grok: curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash
./bootstrap/grok-cli/install.sh --with-codebase-memory
grok login   # or set XAI_API_KEY in .env
```

Installs skills: `adr`, `docs`, `open-questions`, `karpathy-guidelines`, `project-process`, **`catalog-docs`**, plus ponytail path + codebase-memory MCP wiring.  
Details: [bootstrap/grok-cli/README.md](bootstrap/grok-cli/README.md).

### New project process scaffold (DESIGN / ADR / TODO / OQ)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/work/my-app && cd ~/work/my-app && git init
/path/to/pfy-mentat/bootstrap/project-process/init.sh . \
  --name my-app \
  --vision "One-line product vision" \
  --install-skills
```

Or in Grok: `/project-process init .`  
Details: [bootstrap/project-process/README.md](bootstrap/project-process/README.md).

### Container harness (integration lab)

**Prefer testing catalog integrations inside this cage** (versioned images), not only on the host.  
**Filesystem writes:** stock cage MCP can r/w `/workspace`; **write-guard MCP** v0.1 adds audit/enforce policy — `make smoke-write-guard` · [docs/modules/write-guard-mcp.md](docs/modules/write-guard-mcp.md) · ADR-0007.

From **repo root** (do not run bare `make test` expecting cage — use `cage-*` targets):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
make cage-doctor
make cage-setup          # install agentcage CLI
make cage-init           # once → ~/.agentcage runtime project
make cage-up-mcp         # START stack (first build is slow)
make cage-status && make cage-test
make cage-shell          # agent Ubuntu; workspace ~/.agentcage/workspace
make cage-down
```

Or: `cd harness/agent-cage && make help`.

Upstream: [pnnl/agent-cage](https://github.com/pnnl/agent-cage). Runtime dir after init: **`~/.agentcage`**.  
Details: [harness/agent-cage/README.md](harness/agent-cage/README.md).

## Catalog & scoring (summary)

See [CATEGORIZATION.md](CATEGORIZATION.md) and [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md). Tools get Stage 0 gate + weighted Stages 1–4 → overall 0–100 → S/A/B/C tiers. Focus: Grok CLI, tool calling, MCP memory, pipeline extensibility, and deployability.

### Highlighted tools

| Tool | Overall | Tier | Tracking |
|------|---------|------|----------|
| Grok CLI bootstrap | 94 | S | `bootstrap/grok-cli/` |
| project-process bootstrap | 92 | S | `bootstrap/project-process/` |
| **agent-cage (PNNL)** | 90 | S | pin + `harness/agent-cage/` |
| codebase-memory-mcp | 91 | S | pin + bootstrap MCP |
| LiteLLM / Ollama | 93 / 92 | S | pinned_commit |
| repowise / gstack / Multica / mattpocock / marketing-skills | 85–88 | A | pin / skill snapshots |
| colibri | 86 | A | pin (weights not in-repo) |

Full table: [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md). Seeds: [sources/x-posts.md](sources/x-posts.md).

## How to contribute

1. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. High-signal tools that meet the Stage 0 gate are welcome — open an issue or PR with the link and a short justification.
3. New X/tool: apply rubric → **triple-write** x-posts + TOOLS.md + tools.json (or run `/catalog-docs seed`). Automation and operators will triage with receipts on the next pass.
4. Integration experiment: prefer `harness/agent-cage` for isolation; record notes in TOOLS.md.
5. Architecture pivot: `/adr`. Unsettled: `/open-questions`. Docs drift: `/catalog-docs audit`.

All additions should improve the local-first, deployable stack (Grok CLI + MCP + cage + pipeline) or fill a clear gap in the scored catalog.
