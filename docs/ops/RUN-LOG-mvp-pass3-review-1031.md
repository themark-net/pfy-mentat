Worktree: `/home/mark/DEVELOP/pfy-mentat/tmp/mvp-pass3-review-1031`
Branch: `bot/mvp-pass3-review-1031` (tracks `origin/bot/mvp-pass3-review-1031`)
Base: `origin/bot/mvp-integrate-1031`
Review range: `git diff origin/main...origin/bot/mvp-integrate-1031`
Head at start: `0e3291532db3c6f69bfc7ec3c8a04297e5774389`
Needs a local model: no. Cloud Grok only. Never pass `--local`. Do not run `scripts/pregate.sh`.

## LOOP EXIT CARD

```text
LOOP EXIT CARD
Goal (success criteria):     docs/ops/REVIEW-pass3-1031.md exists with a numbered findings table (severity B/S/N, file:line, why, fix) over git diff origin/main...origin/bot/mvp-integrate-1031. Every small S or N finding that sits inside one function is fixed with a behavior or fail/recover test, one commit and one push each. A B finding is fixed only when the fix is under 30 lines and the file is not owned by a live lane. scripts/pfy_build_local.py review code stays untouched and is a cross-lane request. Handoff and a final state line are pushed.
1 Goal met:                  The review file, the handoff, and the run log are on origin/bot/mvp-pass3-review-1031. Each code fix has a targeted unittest that fails if the defect is present. Evaluator is the test runner plus the findings table, not a model score.
2 Turn cap:                  One review pass, then one fix commit per qualifying finding, then further MVP gaps that fit this lane. Stop when the lane is empty or another exit fires.
3 Budget cap:                Cloud Grok only. No local model. No Ollama. No spend beyond this session. No full unittest discover and no pregate unless the end-of-run host check allows pregate once. The drop-in says do not run scripts/pregate.sh.
4 Wall clock:                8 hours from 2026-11-01T00:35:37Z (stop new items by 2026-11-01T08:15:37Z, hard stop 2026-11-01T08:35:37Z) or Sunday 2026-11-01 18:00 PT (2026-11-02T02:00Z), whichever comes first. The 8 hour bound fires first. Leave 20 minutes to write the handoff.
5 No-progress:               The same failure twice with no new information, or 3 items in a row skipped. Record and stop.
6 Human interrupt:           User stop. No questions. Irreversible actions (force push, merge to main, PR, tags, main checkout, other worktrees, signaling processes this run did not start) are forbidden by the drop-in.
7 Error threshold:           3 consecutive same failure, or the same assertion twice. Stop and record. Do not weaken tests.
8 External event:            If origin/main or another bot branch already closed a finding, skip it and say so. Do not check out other branches. This run does not merge.
Loop type:                   goal
Human gate:                  Mark merges after Tester plus Reviewer for runtime changes, or pregate plus Reviewer for docs, eval, or test-only changes. This run does not merge, open a PR, or tag.
```

## Drop-in exits (check before every item)

1. Wall cap: 8 hours from launch, or Sunday 2026-11-01 18:00 PT (PST, 2026-11-02T02:00Z), whichever comes first. Launch 2026-11-01T00:35:37Z, so the 8 hour bound is 2026-11-01T08:35:37Z and it fires first. Stop new items by 2026-11-01T08:15:37Z.
2. Lane empty: no item left that fits the lane and these rules.
3. No progress: the same failure twice with no new information, or 3 items in a row skipped. Record and stop.
4. Host pressure: MemAvailable under 16 GiB, or load over 2x cores (64) for 5 minutes. Pause 10 minutes, then stop if it persists.
5. Red base: tests that fail on the base before the change. Record them and skip that area. Do not stop the lane.

Host at start: MemAvailable 74373880 kB (about 70.9 GiB), load 2.82 3.31 3.83, nproc 32. Under the pressure line.

## Plan

Overview: Review the integrate-pass-3 tree against origin/main the way the Reviewer does. Record every finding. Fix the small ones that this lane may touch. Leave live-lane files and large blockers as write-ups and cross-lane requests. Finish with a handoff.

Phases:
- exits | `docs/ops/RUN-LOG-mvp-pass3-review-1031.md`, `docs/ops/AUTONOMOUS-DECISIONS-mvp-pass3-review-1031.md` | exit card on disk before the review | none | lead
- fetch-scope | read only | `git fetch origin`. Three-dot diff stat. Confirm the review file is absent on the base and on origin/main. List live-lane owned paths and skip them | exits | lead
- review | `docs/ops/REVIEW-pass3-1031.md` | numbered findings table: severity B/S/N, file:line, why, fix. Axes: correctness, fail-closed, tautological tests, docs that contradict code, dead code, secrets, /tmp use | fetch-scope | lead, with read-only review sub-agents on disjoint path groups
- fixes | one function per qualifying finding, plus a behavior test in `tests/` | each small S or N inside one function is one commit and one push. B only when the fix is under 30 lines. No edit to `scripts/pfy_build_local.py` review code | review | lead
- further-gaps | owned files only | next MVP gap that is a review defect in this diff, or lane-empty | fixes | lead
- handoff | `docs/ops/HANDOFF-mvp-pass3-review-1031.md`, this log | handoff committed and pushed. Final `state:` line. No merge | last, on any exit | lead

Owned for edits: this lane's `docs/ops/REVIEW-pass3-1031.md`, `docs/ops/RUN-LOG-mvp-pass3-review-1031.md`, `docs/ops/AUTONOMOUS-DECISIONS-mvp-pass3-review-1031.md`, `docs/ops/HANDOFF-mvp-pass3-review-1031.md`, and the single function plus its behavior test for each qualifying finding. Forbidden: `scripts/pfy_build_local.py` review code (mvp3 live lane), any file a live lane owns, Mark's main checkout, other worktrees, `/tmp`.

Severity used in the table:
- B: blocker. Wrong behavior, fail-open, a secret, or a test that cannot catch the bug it claims. Fix only under 30 lines and only off a live lane's files.
- S: should-fix. Real defect. Fix when the change stays inside one function.
- N: nit. Dead code, a doc that contradicts code, or a small scratch-path miss. Fix when it stays inside one function.

Risks:
- The three-dot diff is large. Mitigation: review by path group, cite file:line from the integrate tip, and say which groups were read.
- A fix lands in a file another lane is editing. Mitigation: if the path is a live lane's owned file, write a cross-lane request and do not edit.
- A "behavior test" restates the fix. Mitigation: the test must fail on the old behavior (negative path or a planted bad input).
- A secret appears in the diff. Mitigation: record the path and the kind of secret. Do not copy the value into the review, the log, or a commit.
- Scratch under `/tmp`. Mitigation: new tests and helpers use this worktree's `tmp/` and set `TMPDIR` there.

## Phases

### exits

Exit card and phase plan written before the diff review and before any product code. Skills `write-loop-exits-first` and `repo-handoff-doc-required` are not files in this worktree or `~/.grok/skills`. The card above plus the drop-in exits stand in for them. Decision logged in `docs/ops/AUTONOMOUS-DECISIONS-mvp-pass3-review-1031.md`.

Parallel product sub-agents are not used for fixes. Fixes share this branch and must commit and push one at a time. Read-only review sub-agents may split the diff after fetch-scope. The lead writes the findings table.

prior-state: DONE | tests: none (docs only) | files: 2 | err: none

exits | 5b0e04f | none (docs only) | pushed

### fetch-scope

Checked 2026-11-01T00:36Z. `origin/bot/mvp-integrate-1031` is `1dee0b9`. This branch was `0e32915` (drop-in) and is now `5b0e04f` (exit card) on top of that tip. `origin/main` is `c0d38af`, which is the merge base. Three-dot range is 522 commits, 619 files, 40387 insertions, 555 deletions. `docs/ops/REVIEW-pass3-1031.md` is absent on the base and on `origin/main`.

Runtime delta: `scripts/pfy_build_cloud.py` (+1562), `scripts/pfy_build_local.py` (+1564, review code is cross-lane, do not edit), `scripts/check_workflow_image_pin.py` (+274), `pfylib/attach.py` (+186), plus smaller edits in `pfylib/build_preflight.py`, `scripts/pfy`, `scripts/pregate.sh`, `scripts/pfy_local_build_eval.py`, `scripts/catalog_stage_eval.py`. 389 of the 619 paths are under `eval/`.

Host still under the pressure line at fetch time (same boot, load was 2.82 on 32 cores, MemAvailable about 70.9 GiB). Wall cap has not fired.

Live lanes at review time, from their drop-ins, not by signaling them: mvp3 and mvp-probe-fix2 own `scripts/pfy_build_local.py`. mvp-timeoutfix and mvp-cloud-perf own `scripts/pfy_build_cloud.py`. Findings in those files are cross-lane.

fetch-scope | 5b0e04f | none (read only) | 619 files, review file absent on base and main

### review

Findings are in `docs/ops/REVIEW-pass3-1031.md`. Seven rows. Two S rows are in `scripts/check_workflow_image_pin.py` and will be fixed here. The B rows and the cloud S/N rows stay cross-lane.

Host before the review commit: MemAvailable about 68 GiB, load about 3.8 on 32 cores. Wall cap 2026-11-01T08:15:37Z has not fired.

review | 9d23087 | none (docs) | 7 findings filed

finding-5-echo-install | 99016b9 | nice python3 -m unittest tests.test_workflow_image_pin (6 ripgrep cases) | was red (helper PASS), now OK

finding-6-echo-rg | 430d49a | nice python3 -m unittest tests.test_workflow_image_pin | was red (helper PASS), module OK after the fix (33 OK, 19.925s)

### further-gaps

Checked 2026-11-01T00:54Z. MemAvailable about 68 GiB, load about 5.7 on 32 cores. Wall cap 2026-11-01T08:15:37Z has not fired. Host pressure has not fired.

No other one-function defect in a file this lane may edit. A scan of added test lines found no `assertTrue(True)` and no `assertEqual(x, x)`. `assertIsNotNone` hits can fail and were not filed. `command echo` and `busybox echo` still pass the echo skip. Not filed. Decision 7. Decision 8 stops the lane.

further-gaps | none | none | lane empty

### handoff

Handoff is `docs/ops/HANDOFF-mvp-pass3-review-1031.md`. Pregate not run: the drop-in forbids `scripts/pregate.sh`. `pgrep -f 'Runner[.]Worker'` was empty at finish, which would have allowed one pregate under the shared-host rule. The lane ban stands.

state: lane empty | findings 5 and 6 fixed and pushed; findings 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 are cross-lane; pregate not run
