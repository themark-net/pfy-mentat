# Daily command: `./pfy build`

Operator card for one headless build. Default is cloud Grok. Review is on. Nothing is pushed. The structural map is [pfy-build.md](../modules/pfy-build.md).

Daily command:

```bash
./pfy build "<task>"
```

A PASS leaves a branch whose name starts with `cloud/`, one commit, and a receipt. The caller's branch and `git status` stay as they were. The runner does not push and does not open a PR.

Measured verdict, read 2026-11-01T00:08:54Z: GO for this daily command. Line-by-line evidence is [VERDICT.md](../../eval/mvp-1031/VERDICT.md). The six-task bar on the integration tip is 6/6 twice ([sixtask-int](../../eval/mvp-1031/sixtask-int/REPORT.md)). The older six-task run was NO-GO because test edits were `tests-tampered` before `--writable-test` ([sixtask](../../eval/mvp-1031/sixtask/REPORT.md)). Selfhost runner PASS is 14/15 and human accept is 13/15 ([selfhost](../../eval/selfhost-1031/REPORT.md)).

## What is not the daily command

`./pfy build --local "<task>"` is the opt-in fallback for when a cloud receipt says `rate-limit`. The flag `--local` is opt-in and not the default. MVP-2 and MVP-3 measured local as NO-GO for the default (cloud 6/6 in 583.6 s; local loop 5/6 gate, 4/6 human accept, 3859.9 s). Cloud numbers are in [eval/mvp2/REPORT.md](../../eval/mvp2/REPORT.md) and [HANDOFF-mvp2-trial.md](HANDOFF-mvp2-trial.md). The MVP-3 local loop wall time is 3859.9 s ([eval/mvp3/REPORT.md](../../eval/mvp3/REPORT.md)). A rate limit does not auto-start `--local`. DevBot or Hermes runs the fallback later, under `flock ~/DEVELOP/pfy-mentat/tmp/heavy-1030.lock`, only when the lane chooses it.

`./pfy build -p "<prompt>"` stays the jev dogfood wrap (`scripts/pfy_build_p.py`, receipt.jsonl under `pipelines/dogfood/build/`). `-p` remains the jev dogfood wrap. Its exit codes and receipt path do not change. `./pfy build --prompt` and `./pfy build --prompt-file` stay on that same wrap. Any argv that contains `--local` stays on `scripts/pfy_build_local.py`.

## Dispatch

The runner is `scripts/pfy_build_cloud.py`. `scripts/pfy` `cmd_build` sends a task that is not `-p`, `--prompt`, `--prompt-file`, or `--local` to that runner. `./pfy build --help` names the daily command, the `-p` dogfood wrap, `--local` as the opt-in fallback, and `--writable-test`. This card does not change `scripts/pfy`.

The runner does not read `auth.json`. Grok uses the operator login that already exists outside the worktree. Auth failure is whatever grok prints, or a missing grok binary. Tests use a fake grok and do not stat the auth file.

## Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--repo DIR` | Git repo to build. Default is the repo that contains `./pfy`. The caller checkout is never the worktree. |
| `--base REF` | Base ref. When HEAD matches `origin/main`, that is the default. When they differ, the run exits 2 until you pass `--base origin/main` or `--base HEAD`. When `origin/main` is absent, the default is HEAD. |
| `--test-cmd CMD` | Gate command. Default `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .`. |
| `--retries N` | Extra attempts after the first. Default 2, so 3 attempts total. |
| `--no-review` | One attempt, no review call. Default is review on. |
| `--writable-test PATH` | Protected gate or eval path the task may edit. Repeat the flag for each path. Ordinary files under `tests/` may change without it. Deleting a base test is still `tests-tampered`. |
| `--receipt-dir DIR` | Where to write the receipt. Default is under `pipelines/dogfood/build-cloud/<stamp>/`. |
| `--dry-run` | Plan only. Exit 0. No grok, no branch. |
| `--reap` | Clean a cloud run that died before it could write a receipt. Exit 0. |
| `--keep-worktree` | Leave the short worktree in place (mode 0700). Default removes it when the run finishes. |
| `--timeout SEC` | Bound the run. Exit 3 when it fires. |
| `--review-file-cap N` | Max characters of one file's diff in a review prompt. Default 12000. `PFY_REVIEW_FILE_CAP` is the same knob. When both are set, the flag wins. A file over the cap is `review-file-too-large` before the post-change gate. |

Protected paths, which still need `--writable-test`, are the pregate gate-hash basenames (`conftest.py`, `pytest.ini`, `tox.ini`, `setup.cfg`, `pyproject.toml`, `sitecustomize.py`, `usercustomize.py`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, anywhere in the tree), plus `examples/eval-harness/`, `.github/workflows/`, `scripts/pregate.sh`, `scripts/pfy`, and `scripts/pfy_build_cloud.py`.

## Exit codes

| Code | When |
|------|------|
| 0 | PASS, dry-run, or `--reap` |
| 1 | FAIL |
| 2 | usage |
| 3 | TIMEOUT |
| 4 | BLOCKED |

`--reap` exits 0 while the receipt `status` is `ABORTED`.

## What PASS looks like

Exit 0. Stdout has one summary line:

```text
PASS ok branch=cloud/<slug>-<stamp> receipt=<path>
```

`<path>` is `pipelines/dogfood/build-cloud/<stamp>/receipt.json` unless `--receipt-dir` overrides the directory. Schema is `pfy-cloud-build/1`. PASS fields: `status` `PASS`, `reason` `ok`, `branch` starting `cloud/`, `commit` (40 hex characters), `review.verdict` `accept`, `attempts` (at least one, last item `status` `PASS`), `gate`, `pushed` false. Also present: `schema`, `exit_code` 0, `base`, `review.reasons` (a list), `gate.cmd`, `gate.before`, `gate.after`, `recovery` (empty string on PASS), `worktree_removed` true unless `--keep-worktree`.

```json
{
  "schema": "pfy-cloud-build/1",
  "status": "PASS",
  "reason": "ok",
  "exit_code": 0,
  "branch": "cloud/<slug>-<stamp>",
  "commit": "<40 hex>",
  "base": "origin/main",
  "review": {"verdict": "accept", "reasons": []},
  "attempts": [{"status": "PASS"}],
  "gate": {"cmd": "python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .", "before": "<outcome before the edit>", "after": "<outcome after the edit>"},
  "recovery": "",
  "pushed": false,
  "worktree_removed": true
}
```

`git rev-parse <branch>` equals `commit`. That commit is not the caller's previous HEAD. The caller's branch name and `git status --porcelain` are unchanged. The runner does not stash, reset, or commit in the caller checkout. The commit tree contains only paths the review saw. Nothing was pushed.

## What dry-run looks like

`./pfy build "<task>" --dry-run` exits 0, starts no grok, writes no branch, and writes a receipt with `status` `DRY-RUN` and `commit` null.

## What usage looks like

`./pfy build` with no task exits 2 and prints the daily command, plus a pointer that `-p` remains the jev dogfood wrap and that `--local` is opt-in and not the default.

## What TIMEOUT looks like

Exit 3. No branch. Receipt `status` `TIMEOUT`, `reason` `timeout`. Rerun with a longer `--timeout`. No commit.

## Failures and recovery

The runner does not read `auth.json`. A rate limit does not auto-start `--local`. When `recovery` is not empty, that same line is printed on stderr. Printing it does not start the command.

| Case | Exit | Receipt | Recovery |
|------|------|---------|----------|
| `rate-limit` | 4 BLOCKED | `status` `BLOCKED`, `reason` `rate-limit`, no branch | `recovery` is the exact `./pfy build --local "<task>"` command. This run does not start it. A rate limit does not auto-start `--local`. |
| `unauthenticated` | 1 FAIL | `status` `FAIL`, `reason` `unauthenticated`, no branch | Run grok once to log in, then rerun the same `./pfy build`. The runner does not read `auth.json` and does not suggest `--local`. |
| gate red | 1 FAIL when retries are spent. The exit stays open while retries remain. | Attempt `reason` `tests`, `tests-flaky`, or `tests-tampered`. Final `status` `FAIL` when spent. No branch. Default `attempts` length is 3. | The next grok call gets the gate tail. When retries are spent, fix the task or the test command and rerun. The failed tree is not committed. |
| `gate-missing` | 2 usage | The gate binary was not found. No grok call. | Pass `--test-cmd` with a command that exists. The default is `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .`. |
| `gate-unusable` | 2 usage | The default unittest command failed with an import error before any edit. No grok call. | Pass `--test-cmd` with an interpreter that can import this repo. A custom gate that fails an assertion still retries. |
| `review-rejected` | 1 FAIL when retries are spent. The exit stays open while retries remain. | Attempt `status` `PASS-REJECTED`, `reason` `review-rejected`, `review.verdict` `reject`. Final `status` `FAIL` when spent. No branch. | The next grok call gets the reject reasons and the previous diff. When retries are spent, rerun with a tighter task, or pass `--no-review` only when an unreviewed commit is acceptable. Review stays on by default. One rejected file rejects the whole build. A review that stops before the last file is a reject, so an unread file is not published. A reviewed run records `impact.source` as `codebase-memory-mcp`, `tree-sitter-analyzer`, or `git-grep`. A missing impact tool does not fail the build. |
| `review-file-too-large` | 1 FAIL. No retry. | `reason` `review-file-too-large`, `phase` `precheck`, no review call, no branch. The post-change gate does not start. | The named file is over the per-file cap (`--review-file-cap` or `PFY_REVIEW_FILE_CAP`, default 12000). Split that file and rerun `./pfy build`. |
| `no-change` | 1 FAIL when retries are spent. The attempt counts while retries remain. | Attempt `reason` `no-change`. No branch. | The gate still runs. Feedback includes the gate tail, not only the word `no-change`. A green gate with an empty diff is still `no-change`. There is no empty PASS. |
| `scope-commit-mismatch` | 1 FAIL | `reason` `scope-commit-mismatch`. Index reset. No branch. | The commit set is the reviewed path list. `git add -A -f` is not the cloud commit. A staged name outside that list aborts the commit. |
| dirty caller | 0 when the new worktree base is clean. 1 when the base ref cannot be checked out (`reason` `worktree-failed`). | A PASS receipt names the new branch only. Dirty caller files are not in the new commit. | The runner never stashes or resets the caller. Dirty caller files stay dirty. |
| `interrupted` | 1 FAIL | `status` `FAIL`, `reason` `interrupted`. No branch. SIGINT or SIGTERM. | The grok process group is signaled. Rerun the same command when the task should run again. |
| `recheck-env-failed` | 1 FAIL. No retry. | `reason` `recheck-env-failed`. No branch. The agent is not called again. | The recheck gate failed on the new commit and on the base commit in the same way. Fix the checkout or the test command, then rerun `./pfy build`. |
| `ABORTED` | `--reap` exits 0. The killed run wrote nothing. | `status` `ABORTED`, `reason` `no-receipt`, for a cloud pid-file entry whose receipt is missing. | After SIGKILL, run `./pfy build --reap`. Reap signals only pgids in `tmp/cloud-build.pids.json`. It does not signal pgids listed only in `tmp/local-build.pids.json`. |

## Commit recheck

After the post-change gate passes, the runner checks the new commit in a detached worktree of the same repo (`git worktree add --detach`). That copy has the repo history and its own temp dir. The directory is created mode 0700 before add, so a short parent such as `/var/tmp` is not left world-readable. `worktree add` uses an empty hooks path, so a checkout hook does not run. The gate process is not given `GIT_CONFIG_*`. The runner removes the worktree and prunes it on the way out, including when the gate times out, is interrupted, rewrites files, or raises.

If that gate fails, the runner rechecks the base commit the same way. When the base fails the same tests, or both fail with the same tail, the receipt reason is `recheck-env-failed`. The run stops. The failure is not sent back to the agent.

A docs-only diff is one where every changed path is under `docs/` or ends in `.md`, and no path is code, tests, or config. That diff skips the flake gate. The suite then runs at most twice for the attempt: the post-change gate and the commit recheck.

History checks that name a fixed commit skip when `git cat-file -e <sha>^{commit}` fails. That covers a shallow clone and any other checkout that does not contain the commit. A checkout that has the commit still runs the check.

## Receipt rules

Receipt text is redacted (token, bearer, AKIA, private-key blocks). A short fixture assignment such as `user_key=list-user` stays readable. An uppercase name such as `API_TOKEN`, a name that contains password or secret, and a value that mixes letters and digits are still replaced with `[redacted]`. A receipt that still contains those raw forms is a failed run. Do not paste a receipt that holds a live token into chat or into git. The demo copy that integration keeps is `eval/mvp-1031/demo-receipt.json` on the integrate branch, not a default receipt under `pipelines/dogfood/build-cloud/`.

Pid file: `<repo>/tmp/cloud-build.pids.json`. Worktree: `/var/tmp/pfyb-<stamp>-<pid>` (mode 0700), or `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/pfyb-<stamp>-<pid>` when that directory is outside `/tmp` and `/run` and the harness2 socket still fits in 107 bytes, otherwise `~/.cache/pfyb-<stamp>-<pid>`. `PFY_BUILD_WORKTREE_ROOT` replaces that search. Removed when the run finishes unless `--keep-worktree`. Branch prefix: `cloud/`. The branch ref remains after the worktree is removed. The lock stays `<repo>/tmp/cloud-build.lock`.

Default protect globs include `auth.json`, `.env`, `*.pem`, and `pipelines/dogfood/**/grok-home/**`. Protect means those paths are not committed. It does not mean the runner opens `auth.json`.

[ADR-0014](../adr/0014-pluggable-local-inference-spine.md) is the inference spine, not the build default. Surface split: [local-cloud-split.md](local-cloud-split.md).

## Demo 2026-10-31

Copied from [eval/mvp-1031/REPORT.md](../../eval/mvp-1031/REPORT.md). One real cloud `./pfy build` from the integrate worktree. No `--local`. The task target was a temp fixture repo, not this checkout. The fixture test was red before the build (`add(2, 3)` returned 0).

Command:

```text
bash eval/mvp-1031/init_fixture.sh "$PWD/tmp/mvp-fixture-repo"
./pfy build "Make add return the sum of its two arguments so the fixture test passes." \
  --repo "$PWD/tmp/mvp-fixture-repo" \
  --base main \
  --test-cmd "python3 -m unittest test_add" \
  --receipt-dir "$PWD/tmp/mvp-fixture-receipt"
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Exit code | 0 |
| Branch | `cloud/make-add-return-the-sum-of-its-two-argum-20261031T210933627529Z` |

| Review verdict | accept |
| Receipt path | `eval/mvp-1031/demo-receipt.json` |

Demo: PASS.

The receipt checker in the report is `python3 eval/mvp-1031/check_receipt.py eval/mvp-1031/demo-receipt.json` with exit 0. `pushed` is false. The integrate branch stayed `bot/mvp-integrate-1031`.
