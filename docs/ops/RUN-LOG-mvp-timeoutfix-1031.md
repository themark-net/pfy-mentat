# RUN-LOG mvp-timeoutfix-1031

Lane: cloud-runner findings from late dogfood (wave 5).
Branch: `bot/mvp-timeoutfix-1031`
Worktree: `~/DEVELOP/pfy-mentat/tmp/mvp-timeoutfix-1031`
Base: `origin/bot/mvp-cloudfix-1031` (merge `origin/bot/mvp-integrate-1031` first; merge cloudfix again before each push).
Launch: 2026-11-01T00:00:55Z (2026-10-31 17:00:55 PT).
Binding wall: 2026-11-01T08:00:55Z (8h from launch). Sunday 2026-11-02T02:00Z is later, so the 8h cap binds.
Handoff buffer: stop new items at 2026-11-01T07:40:55Z.

## LOOP EXIT CARD

```text
LOOP EXIT CARD
Goal (success criteria):     dogfood2 row 07 review-reject no longer ends as TIMEOUT; receipt reason and recovery match the outcome; time budget holds. Every cloud-runner finding in gom-dogfood wave 5, selfhost2, and dogfood2 that is not already fixed on origin/bot/mvp-cloudfix-1031 is fixed or logged skipped, each with a behavior or fail/recover test. Poll those three branches until 60 quiet minutes.
1 Goal met:                  targeted unittest modules green for each code change; run log item lines; handoff written
2 Turn cap:                  8 code items, then handoff. Polls do not count as code turns.
3 Budget cap:                cloud Grok session only. No local model. No --local. No spend beyond this session.
4 Wall clock:                2026-11-01T08:00:55Z, or 2026-11-02T02:00Z, whichever first. Leave 20 minutes for the handoff.
5 No-progress:               same failure twice with no new information, or 3 items skipped in a row
6 Human interrupt:           user stop. Do not ask. Conservative decision logged, then continue.
7 Error threshold:           3 consecutive same test or merge failures, then stop
8 External event:            a finding already fixed on origin/bot/mvp-cloudfix-1031 or origin/main is skipped, not reimplemented
Loop type:                   goal, with a 20-minute time poll of the three dogfood branches
Human gate:                  no merge to main, no PR, no tags. Push only bot/mvp-timeoutfix-1031.
```

Named skills `write-loop-exits-first` and `repo-handoff-doc-required` are not files in this worktree or `~/.grok/skills`. This card, the drop-in exit list, and `docs/ops/HANDOFF-mvp-timeoutfix-1031.md` are the binding. Decision logged.

## Phases

Overview: Merge the integrate tip, confirm why a review reject became a cloud TIMEOUT (exit 3, gate -15), fix receipt reason and recovery inside the time budget, then take every still-open cloud-runner finding from the three late dogfood branches. One function per change on `scripts/pfy_build_cloud.py`. Merge cloudfix before each push. Poll every 20 minutes. Stop after 60 quiet minutes or a wall exit.

- exits | docs/ops/RUN-LOG-mvp-timeoutfix-1031.md, docs/ops/AUTONOMOUS-DECISIONS-mvp-timeoutfix-1031.md | exit card on the branch | none | general
- merge-integrate | merge only | `origin/bot/mvp-integrate-1031` merged, never rebased | exits | general
- row07-timeout | scripts/pfy_build_cloud.py (one function) plus its behavior test | review-rejected does not surface as TIMEOUT; receipt reason and recovery are right; time budget respected | merge-integrate | investigate then general
- dogfood-findings | same cloud runner file, one function per finding, plus behavior tests | each cloud-runner finding from gom-dogfood wave 5, selfhost2, and dogfood2 is fixed or recorded as already on cloudfix | row07-timeout | general
- poll | read-only fetch of the three branches | 60 minutes with no new cloud-runner finding, or wall cap | dogfood-findings | general
- handoff | docs/ops/HANDOFF-mvp-timeoutfix-1031.md and this log | state line and handoff pushed | any exit | general

Risks:
- Live cloudfix lane edits `scripts/pfy_build_cloud.py`. Mitigation: one function per change, merge `origin/bot/mvp-cloudfix-1031` before each push, abort the push on a conflict I cannot resolve inside that one function.
- Integrate pass 3 may still be moving. Mitigation: merge the tip that fetch returns; do not rebase; if the merge conflicts outside this lane's files, record a cross-lane request and keep the conflict out of product code I do not own.
- A fix that needs a new architecture decision. Mitigation: OQ draft in the handoff, skip the item.
- Sub-agents on this worktree would collide on the hot file. Mitigation: lead does the code in this worktree. `project-map` may write only `.project-map/`.

## Item log

Format: `item | commit | tests | result`

merge-integrate | 3076762 | tests.test_pfy_build_cloud tests.test_pfy_build_p 77 OK skipped 1 (baseline after the merge, before the row 07 patch) | PASS clean merge of origin/bot/mvp-integrate-1031 at dd1db3b
merge-cloudfix | e84a9ce | same baseline | PASS clean merge of origin/bot/mvp-cloudfix-1031 at 8047018 (run log line only)
row07-timeout | dd807fc | tests.test_pfy_build_cloud tests.test_pfy_build_p 79 OK skipped 1 in 24.679s | PASS a review-reject retry that times out is FAIL review-rejected exit 1 and keeps the reject reasons; a review call on a fresh attempt shares the run budget and still exits 3
already-on-integrate | 3076762 | not reimplemented | dogfood2 F1 (commit subject), gom wave 5 #2 gate-unusable on the default unittest command, #3 resolve_base, #4 redact short fixture values, #5 gate env denylist, #6 commit subject. Confirmed on the merged tree.
poll-0018Z | none | read-only | dogfood2 b90ae61 (run 08 PASS, findings still F1-F3), gom 88a841b, selfhost2 1b7722d, cloudfix 8047018. No new cloud-runner finding. Quiet clock starts 2026-11-01T00:18Z. Next poll due 00:38Z. F2 and F3 remain.
dogfood2-F2 | a450f5b | tests.test_pfy_build_cloud tests.test_pfy_build_p 80 OK skipped 1 in 24.776s | PASS review.truncated matches the review prompt cut marker (false under the cap, true past it)
merge-cloudfix-2 | c9bef6c | docs only on their side | PASS merge of origin/bot/mvp-cloudfix-1031 at 10b4f5b (handoff, no runner change) before the F2 push
dogfood2-F3 | 270f75f | tests.test_pfy_build_cloud tests.test_pfy_build_p 81 OK skipped 1 in 24.849s | PASS review-rejected attempt keeps a unified diff after the worktree is removed
poll-0026Z | none | read-only | dogfood2 bea476d adds run 09 PASS, no new finding id. gom still 88a841b. selfhost2 16c59c2 records kolibri archive recheck walking into the caller repo. That finding resets the quiet clock.
selfhost2-kolibri-recheck | ff6b855 | tests.test_pfy_build_cloud tests.test_pfy_build_p exit 0; new test red first (exit 1 commit-recheck-failed) then green; helper recheck test still green | PASS recheck git toplevel is the extract. Quiet clock restarts 2026-11-01T00:29Z. Next poll 00:49Z.
skip-gom-tamper-usage | none | not run | SKIP the rest of wave 5 #1. Hash on base tests already stays. A usage note for a task that should add a test needs an OQ, not a heuristic.
skip-gate-allowlist | none | not run | SKIP. Gate denylist already hides secret-like names. A PATH/TMPDIR allowlist would break venv gates. OQ in the handoff.
cross-lane-timeout-docs | none | not run | NOT EDITED. mvp-surface owns pfy-build.md and pfy-build-daily.md. --timeout wording drifts from the run budget. Request in the handoff.
poll-0049Z | none | read-only | dogfood2 ac42593 handed off after run 09. Findings still F1-F3 only (F1 already on the integrate tip, F2 and F3 fixed here). gom still 88a841b. selfhost2 88f5d99 item 03 PASS, no new runner friction. Quiet clock stays 00:29Z. Next poll 01:09Z. Stop at 01:29Z if still quiet.
poll-0109Z | none | read-only | dogfood2 still ac42593. gom still 88a841b. cloudfix still 10b4f5b. selfhost2 91ad247 items 04-07 PASS. Item 04 review reject of Path.rglob recurse_symlinks was the right verdict, not a runner bug. Quiet clock stays 00:29Z. Next poll 01:29Z.
poll-0129Z | none | read-only | dogfood2 still ac42593. gom still 88a841b. cloudfix still 10b4f5b. selfhost2 8b158e1 items 08-12 PASS, decisions are product symlink choices, no new runner friction. 60 quiet minutes since 00:29Z.

state: lane empty | 60 quiet minutes after the kolibri finding at 2026-11-01T00:29Z. Polls at 00:49Z, 01:09Z, and 01:29Z added no new cloud-runner finding. Wall cap and host pressure did not fire. Handoff docs/ops/HANDOFF-mvp-timeoutfix-1031.md. No merge.
