## 2026-09-28 — founder standings into portable skills SoT

- **Branch:** `bot/skills-port-standings-20260928` (from main `bd35bad`)
- **Prior:** stalled `bot/skills-port-standings-20260925` @ `d262300` cherry-picked here. That branch was never a PR. Do not force-push `main`.
- **Landed:** `prefer-behavior-and-fail-recover-tests`, `ui-is-the-app-design-in-loop`, `best-effort-and-bot-budget-build-max`
- **SoT:** `bootstrap/grok-cli/skills/<name>/` (org bot skills stay pointers). Project mirror: `.grok/skills/`.
- **Out of scope:** catalog 70–75 HOLD, LIVE_HARD_OFF, product UI, Feature GO.
- **Verify:** `make smoke-grok-skills`
- **Next:** merge the docs/skills PR when checks are green. Pattern: [port-bot-doctrine-to-pfy-sot.md](ops/port-bot-doctrine-to-pfy-sot.md).
