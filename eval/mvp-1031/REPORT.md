# mvp-1031 integrate demo

One real cloud `./pfy build` from the integrate worktree. No `--local`. The task target was a temp fixture repo, not this checkout.

Command:

```text
bash eval/mvp-1031/init_fixture.sh "$PWD/tmp/mvp-fixture-repo"
./pfy build "Make add return the sum of its two arguments so the fixture test passes." \
  --repo "$PWD/tmp/mvp-fixture-repo" \
  --base main \
  --test-cmd "python3 -m unittest test_add" \
  --receipt-dir "$PWD/tmp/mvp-fixture-receipt"
```

The fixture test was red before the build (`add(2, 3)` returned 0).

Demo: PASS.

`git -C` the fixture repo shows that `cloud/` branch at the receipt commit. `add` on that commit returns `a + b`, and `python3 -m unittest test_add` passes on that tree. `pushed` is false. The integrate branch stayed `bot/mvp-integrate-1031`.

## Pass 2

One real cloud `./pfy build` on a throwaway clone of this worktree. No `--local`. No second cloud call. The integrate checkout was not the task target.

Task: on the not-ok branch of `arm_launch_env_session` in `scripts/pfy_enterable_162.py`, store the stripped `next_steps` before returning, and add `tests.test_attach.OpenCodeEnterableTests.test_not_ok_drops_stale_enterable_step`.

Why picked: the not-ok return drops the stripped list, so a stale `enterable` id stays. A local call on this tree before the build printed `STALE_SURVIVES True` with ids `enterable` and `status`. Dogfood run 01 named that bug. The change is two files, the shim plus a behavior test. Neither file is owned by an MVP lane. T-0124 already folded the OpenCode open path. This is the leftover fail path in the shim.

Command (from this worktree):

```text
./pfy build "On the not-ok branch of arm_launch_env_session in scripts/pfy_enterable_162.py, store the stripped next_steps on the result before returning. A caller that passed next_steps with id enterable or session must not see those ids when ok is false. Add tests.test_attach.OpenCodeEnterableTests.test_not_ok_drops_stale_enterable_step in tests/test_attach.py. The test calls arm_launch_env_session with ok false, live FAIL, and a next_steps entry whose id is enterable, then asserts that id is absent, session_reach is FAIL, and enterable is false. The test fails if the early return keeps the stale id. Edit only those two files." \
  --repo "$PWD/tmp/demo2-target" \
  --base demo-base \
  --test-cmd "python3 -m unittest tests.test_attach.OpenCodeEnterableTests.test_not_ok_drops_stale_enterable_step" \
  --writable-test tests/test_attach.py \
  --receipt-dir "$PWD/tmp/demo2-receipt"
```

`--base demo-base` keeps the clone off `origin/main`. `--test-cmd` is the new test, because the default discover is red on two recorded failures outside this task. `--writable-test` allows the edit of the existing test module. `--receipt-dir` is the copy source. The clone was `git clone --local` of this worktree, then `checkout -B demo-base`.

Demo 2: PASS.

Human verdict: the cloud commit adds one assignment, `out["next_steps"] = next_steps`, on the not-ok branch, and a test that fails while those ids remain. On the clone, that test passes at the receipt commit. With only the test file and the pre-fix shim, the same test fails: `enterable` is still in `['enterable', 'session', 'env']`. The commit touches only `scripts/pfy_enterable_162.py` and `tests/test_attach.py`. It is not on `bot/mvp-integrate-1031`. This lane does not land it. `pushed` is false.

Functional MVP DoD lines:

4. PASS. `git -C tmp/demo2-target rev-parse` of that branch equals `535d000075744709b2752cec7511d087801f2aa5`. During the run the caller stayed `bot/mvp-integrate-1031` at `135eebb` with an empty porcelain. The cloud commit is not that HEAD. The clone stayed on `demo-base`.
5. PASS. `git diff-tree --name-only` of the commit is only the two task paths. No gitignored extra file is in the tree.
6. PASS. Nothing was pushed. No PR was opened. `pushed` is false. The integrate repo has no `cloud/` branch from this run.

## Pass 3

One real cloud `./pfy build` on a throwaway clone of this worktree. No `--local`. No second cloud call. The integrate checkout was not the task target.

Task: stop `tests/test_x_intake_smoke_117_118.py` and `tests/test_x_intake_smoke_119_121.py` from writing `pipelines/smoke` receipts inside the repo, and add `tests/test_x_intake_smoke_117_119_receipts.py` that fails if those bytes change.

Why picked: MVP-2 t5. Those two modules call the smoke with no `PFY_SMOKE_RECEIPT_DIR`, and `_receipt` reads `pipelines/smoke/<entry>/latest.json` in the repo. On this tree, before the build, `test_wrong_kander_version_exits_2` rewrote `pipelines/smoke/kander/latest.json` (1216 bytes to 1179) and `test_agentdescent_wrong_version_exits_2` rewrote `pipelines/smoke/agentdescent/latest.json` (618 bytes to 581). Both files were restored. The third file is the guard test. The smoke scripts stay. This is not the enterable fix (backlog-burn already landed that on this branch). Another lane was running the t4 timeout task locally, so this lane did not pick t4.

Command (from this worktree):

```text
./pfy build "Stop tests/test_x_intake_smoke_117_118.py and tests/test_x_intake_smoke_119_121.py from writing pipelines/smoke receipts inside the repo. Match the setUp in tests/test_x_intake_smoke_112_114.py: each test class creates one temp directory, sets PFY_SMOKE_RECEIPT_DIR on the env passed to the smoke, and _receipt reads that directory. Do not read ROOT/pipelines/smoke for the receipt body. Keep the git check-ignore tests. Do not skip tests or weaken assertions. Do not edit the smoke scripts. Add tests/test_x_intake_smoke_117_119_receipts.py. That test runs tests.test_x_intake_smoke_117_118.XIntakeSmoke117118Tests.test_wrong_kander_version_exits_2 and tests.test_x_intake_smoke_119_121.XIntakeSmoke119121Tests.test_agentdescent_wrong_version_exits_2. It fails if either child is not OK, if either says skipped, or if pipelines/smoke/kander/latest.json or pipelines/smoke/agentdescent/latest.json changes bytes. Today both named tests rewrite those repo files. Edit only those three test files." \

```

`--base demo-base` keeps the clone off `origin/main`. `--test-cmd` is the new module, which is absent on the base, so the before gate is red. `--writable-test` names the two existing modules. The clone was `git clone --local` of this worktree at `66a5500`, then `checkout -B demo-base`.

Demo 3: PASS.

Human verdict: the cloud commit adds `setUp` on each test class, sets `PFY_SMOKE_RECEIPT_DIR` in `_env`, and points `_receipt` at that temp directory. The new test runs the two named cases and compares the bytes of the two repo receipts. On a detached worktree of `1ed98a4`, that test passed in 0.209s. The commit touches only the three test paths. It is not on `bot/mvp-integrate-1031`. This lane does not land it. `pushed` is false. The caller stayed `bot/mvp-integrate-1031` at `66a5500` with an empty porcelain. The clone stayed on `demo-base`.

Cloud-default daily use, from `eval/mvp-1031/sixtask-int/REPORT.md`: VERDICT GO. Two passes of MVP-2 t1 through t6 on `./pfy build`, review on, no `--local`, no `--no-review`. Pass 1 wall 1243.8s and pass 2 wall 1016.3s. Each pass is 6/6 runner PASS, 6/6 review accept, 6/6 human accept, 6/6 gate PASS.

## Pass 4

One real cloud `./pfy build` on a throwaway clone of this worktree. No `--local`. No second cloud call. The integrate checkout was not the task target.

Task: protect `.env.bak` and `.env.local` in `scripts/pfy_build_cloud.py`, and add `CloudBuildFailureTests.test_env_bak_and_env_local_are_not_committed`.

Why picked: pass 3 review finding 4. `_protected` still matches `.env` only. `.env.example` must stay unprotected.

Demo 4: FAIL. Review rejected the diff. The gate was red before (missing test) and green after. The reviewer said the basename rule and the new test match the task, and the diff also edits the shared `_run` helper (it strips `GIT_DIR`) and calls `shutil.rmtree` on the fixture receipt directory. This lane agrees. No cloud commit was created. `pushed` is false. The caller stayed `bot/mvp-integrate-pass4-1031` at `f6d1a3b`. The clone stayed on `demo-base`. The protect rule is still open.
