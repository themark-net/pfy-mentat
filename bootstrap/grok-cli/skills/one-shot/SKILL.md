description: >
  Execute a single request with minimal user questions: write Definition of Done,
  check prerequisites (env profile, agent-cage or waived lab), iterate cheap
  local/static/cage verification before cloud, stop when green or budget/blocker.
  Use when the user runs /one-shot, says one-shot, unattended until green,
  minimize questions, or auto-iterate until working. Requires
  docs/ops/one-shot-workflow.md in this repo.

# /one-shot — Unattended-until-green (guardrailed)

Full rules: `docs/ops/one-shot-workflow.md` · ADR-0008.  
**Example DoDs (this repo’s smokes):** `docs/ops/one-shot-example-dods.md`

## On invoke

1. **Restate** the request in one short paragraph.
2. **Write DoD** — numbered pass/fail checks (commands or observable outcomes).
   - If the request matches a catalog smoke, **prefer the ready-made DoD** from
     `docs/ops/one-shot-example-dods.md` and the matching `make smoke-*` target.
3. **List assumptions** you will not ask about.
4. **Prerequisites** (fail closed):
   - `DEPLOY_PROFILE` / `make env-check` if stack work
   - If DoD needs isolation: agent-cage up/status **or** explicit host-only waiver in DoD
   - No missing secrets for profile when cloud tier required
5. **Cost ladder:** tier 0 static → local model → cage smoke → mid cloud → heavy cloud (respect profile max).
6. **Loop:** implement → cheapest verify → fix; max **8** iterations; max **3** identical failures then escalate tier or stop.
7. **Ask the user only if:** hard blocker, missing secret, irreversible product fork, or budget exhausted.
8. **Finish:** report green DoD checklist, paths changed, assumptions, remaining OQ/TODO if any.

## Catalog smoke shortcuts (pfy-mentat)

| Target | Proves |
|--------|--------|
| `make smoke-litellm-ollama` | LiteLLM completion → host Ollama **inside** cage |
| `make smoke-codebase-memory` | codebase-memory-mcp index + search on fixture |
| `make smoke-repowise` | repowise `health` zero-LLM on fixture |
| `make smoke-context-tools` | both context tools + compare note |
| `make smoke-write-guard` | write-guard selftest + audit/enforce |

Host-only `selftest` is tier 0; integration DoD still needs the cage Make target when the request is an integration smoke.

## Do not

- Infinite retries
- Cloud before local/static checks when avoidable
- Scope creep beyond DoD
- Commit secrets; skip triple-write on catalog seeds
- Run destructive host ops outside workspace/cage policy
- Treat host-only checks as substitute for in-cage smoke when DoD says cage
