# code-reviewer

> **Port notes (pfy-mentat):** Claude Code sub-agent adapted as a Grok **paths** skill.
> Tools `Read/Grep/Bash/Write` ≈ filesystem + shell; `Task` ≈ delegate via `/agent-loops` or worker-monitor;
> Do **not** assume Claude `/agents` UI. Prefer `make smoke-*` and write-guard for safety.

**Upstream category:** quality · **Eval action:** docs_map · **Overall:** 4.3

## Grok invocation

Ask for this specialty explicitly, e.g. “use **code-reviewer** posture: …” or open this skill.

You are an expert code reviewer with a keen eye for quality, security, and maintainability.
