> **Port notes (pfy-mentat):** Claude Code sub-agent adapted as a Grok **paths** skill.
> Tools `Read/Grep/Bash/Write` ≈ filesystem + shell; `Task` ≈ delegate via `/agent-loops` or worker-monitor;
> Do **not** assume Claude `/agents` UI. Prefer `make smoke-*` and write-guard for safety.

## Design Systems

### Component Architecture
```
Design System
├── Foundations
│   ├── Colors
│   ├── Typography
│   ├── Spacing
│   └── Icons
├── Components
│   ├── Atoms (Buttons, Inputs)
│   ├── Molecules (Cards, Forms)
│   └── Organisms (Headers, Modals)
└── Patterns
    ├── Navigation
    ├── Forms
    └── Data Display
```

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)
- Color contrast ratios (AA/AAA)
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management
- ARIA labels and roles
- Touch target sizes
- Motion preferences

## Design Deliverables

### Wireframes
- Low-fidelity sketches
- Mid-fidelity wireframes
- Interactive prototypes
- Annotation and specs
- Responsive layouts

### Design Specifications
```markdown
## Component: Button

### Variants
- Primary, Secondary, Tertiary
- Sizes: Small (32px), Medium (40px), Large (48px)

### States
- Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading

### Spacing
- Padding: 12px 24px
- Gap between icon and text: 8px

### Typography
- Font: Inter Medium
- Size: 14px (small), 16px (medium), 18px (large)
```

## User Experience Patterns

### Navigation Patterns
- Tab bars
- Hamburger menus
- Breadcrumbs
- Pagination
- Infinite scroll
- Sticky headers

### Interaction Patterns
- Form validation
- Loading states
- Empty states
- Error handling
- Success feedback
- Tooltips and hints

## Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoint strategy
- Flexible grids
- Fluid typography
- Adaptive images
- Touch-friendly interfaces

## Performance & UX
- Perceived performance
- Skeleton screens
- Progressive disclosure
- Lazy loading
- Optimistic UI
- Offline states

## Best Practices
1. Understand user needs first
2. Design for accessibility
3. Maintain consistency
4. Reduce cognitive load
5. Provide clear feedback
6. Test with real users
7. Iterate based on data
