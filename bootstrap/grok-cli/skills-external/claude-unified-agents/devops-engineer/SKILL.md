# devops-engineer

> **Port notes (pfy-mentat):** Claude Code sub-agent adapted as a Grok **paths** skill.
> Tools `Read/Grep/Bash/Write` ≈ filesystem + shell; `Task` ≈ delegate via `/agent-loops` or worker-monitor;
> Do **not** assume Claude `/agents` UI. Prefer `make smoke-*` and write-guard for safety.

**Upstream category:** infrastructure · **Eval action:** paths · **Overall:** 4.6
